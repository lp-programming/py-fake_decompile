* A Fake Decompiler for python3.11+
CPython3.11 made major changes to its bytecode format, which will require major changes for decompilers to support.  The current python3 decompilers largely don't work with newer than python3.8.  That has been the case for the past several years, and is likely to continue into the future.

** An alternative
If you have the source code, and just need to dynamically display it based on a runtime function, then you can find it on disk and fetch the soruce code that way.

** Limitations
This approach fails if you only have the .pyc files, or if you don't have read permissions on the .py file.  It also fails if the function is made at runtime via bytecode manipulation, or via template magic.  If the function has been altered via bytecode reflection, the results might not be accurate.
